# Go HTTP RPC Sample

This directory contains a sample Go program that calls the Google Natural Language API using HTTP, RPC, and Protocol Buffers.

## Protocol Buffer Support

Message serialization requires Go support code that is generated by protoc and the Go Protocol Buffers plugin. For the Cloud Language API, pre-generated Go code is [here](https://github.com/google/go-genproto/blob/master/googleapis/cloud/language/v1/language_service.pb.go) and is directly imported into the sample.

## Authentication

This sample authenticates with an API key that it reads from the `$GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Build Instructions

To run the sample, copy it to a directory in your `$GOPATH/src`, change to that directory, and run `go get .` and `go run .`.
