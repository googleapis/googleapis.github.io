# GAPIC Generators

Many of Google's API client libraries are automatically generated. These
**Generated API Clients (GAPICs)** are produced from API descriptions written in
the Protocol Buffer language.

The tools and conventions that we use for this are open source. Our generators
are published in the
[googleapis GitHub organization](https://github.com/googleapis). We began with
an initial [gapic-generator](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator) that
produced clients in seven languages, and in 2018, we began developing a new
generation of generators, each written in the language that it generates.
Standards that we use for these generators are described below.
