# GAPIC Generators

**Generated API Clients (GAPICs)** are produced from declarative descriptions
of APIs. These API descriptions are written in the
[Protocol Buffer language](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and
build on nearly 20 years of experience describing APIs within Google.

Our GAPIC generators are open source and are published in
[github.com/googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis). The original
[gapic-generator](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator) produced API
clients in seven languages and continues to be the preferred generator for Java
and PHP.

## Microgenerators

In 2018, we began developing a new set of generators, each written in the
language that it generates. Some of our language-specific GAPIC generators are
listed below:

- [gapic-generator-python](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-python)
- [gapic-generator-go](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-go)
- [gapic-generator-java](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-java)
- [gapic-generator-ruby](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-ruby)
- [gapic-generator-kotlin](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-kotlin)
- [gapic-generator-csharp](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-csharp)
- [gapic-generator-cpp](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-cpp)
- [gapic-generator-typescript](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-typescript)

## Testing GAPIC Generators

To verify GAPIC generator implementations, we test them with a common
[gapic-showcase](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-showcase) API that
"showcases" important GAPIC features.

## Issues

For questions on a specific GAPIC generator, please file an issue on the
corresponding repository.
