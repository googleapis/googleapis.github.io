# Rust HTTP RPC Sample

This directory contains a sample Rust program that calls the Google Natural
Language API using HTTP, RPC, and Protocol Buffers.

## Protocol Buffer Support

Message serialization requires Rust support code that is generated by protoc and
the [Rust Protocol Buffers plugin](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf).

## Authentication

This sample authenticates with an API key that it reads from the
`$GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Instructions

- Build and install `protoc-gen-rust` by running `cargo install protobuf` at the
  command line.

- Run the [SETUP.sh](SETUP.sh) script to generate Protocol Buffer support code.

- Run `cargo run` to build and run the sample.
