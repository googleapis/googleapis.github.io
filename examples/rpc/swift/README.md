# Swift HTTP RPC Sample

This directory contains a sample Swift program that calls the Google Natural
Language API using HTTP, RPC, and Protocol Buffers.

## Protocol Buffer Support

Message serialization requires Swift support code that is generated by protoc
and the
[Swift Protocol Buffers plugin](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf).

## Authentication

This sample authenticates with an API key that it reads from the
`$GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Instructions

- Build and install `protoc-gen-swift` from
  [github.com/apple/swift-protobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf)

- Run the [RUNME](RUNME) script to generate Protocol Buffer support code.

- Run `swift build` to build the sample.

- Run `.build/debug/NaturalLanguage` to run the sample.
