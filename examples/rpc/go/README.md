# Go gRPC Fallback Sample

This directory contains a sample Go program that calls the Google Natural
Language API using the gRPC Fallback protocol described in
[HowToRPC](https://googleapis.github.io/HowToRPC).

## Protocol Buffer Support

Message serialization requires Go support code that is generated by `protoc`
and the [Go Protocol Buffers plugin](https://github.com/golang/protobuf). For
the Cloud Language API, pre-generated Go code is
[here](https://github.com/google/go-genproto/blob/master/googleapis/cloud/language/v1/language_service.pb.go)
and is directly imported into the sample.

## Authentication

This sample authenticates with an API key that it reads from the
`$GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Instructions

To run the sample:

- Copy it to a directory in your `$GOPATH/src`.

- Change to that directory.

- `go get .`

- `go run main.go`
